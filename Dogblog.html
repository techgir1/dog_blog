    <h2>January 4, 2016</h2>
    <p>Today Dusty slept until noon. He got up only to play ball outside.</p>
    <h2>January 5, 2016</h2>
    <p>Dusty can be so stubborn! I have so much trouble finding food he will eat! So far his favorite brands are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Benefil</li>
        <li>kibble</li>
        <li>Dog Food International</p>
      </ul>
